TelegramCSharpForward
-------------------------------

_Unofficial_ Telegram (http://telegram.org) client library implemented in C#.

This Program allows you to <b>redirect all channels you want to an unique channel</b>.

This has been designed to be able to correct the price differences between Axitrader and Vantage / FXCM brokers but in the end it is a simple "CalculOffset (...)" function that you can delete if you are not interested.

The message history is logged in a database (SQLite) in order to be able to manage the Response functionalities because it seems to me that we cannot retrieve the history of a channel for which you are not the administrator.

:star2: If you :heart: library, please star it! :star2:

# How do I add this to my project?

Build from source

1. Clone TLSharp from GitHub
1. Compile source with 2019

# Starter Guide

## Quick Configuration
Telegram API isn't that easy to start. You need to do some configuration first.

1. Create a [developer account](https://my.telegram.org/) in Telegram. 
1. Goto [API development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and copy **API_ID** and **API_HASH** from your account. You'll need it later.

## First requests
To start work, edit the file app.config

```text 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
        <add key="apidId" value="YourApiId" />
        <add key="ApiHash" value="YourApiHash" />
        <add key="SessionName" value="yourSessionName" />
        <add key="PhoneNumber" value="YourPhoneNumberWithAreaCode" />
        <add key="myChanId" value="YourChanIdToRedirectAllMessage" />
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```
When user is authenticated, TLSharp creates special file called TLSharp.dat into C:\Users\<b>YourUsername</b>\AppData\Roaming\TLSharp. 

In this file TLSharp store all information needed for user session. 

So you need to authenticate user every time the TLSharp.dat file is corrupted or removed.

In this directory, you will also find the SQLite database which will be created on the first launch with an error message but if you restart the application then it will work (known bug to be corrected)
